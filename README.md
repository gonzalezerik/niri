# niri, HDR branch (`erikg-hdr`)

This is my personal build of [niri](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri), the scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor. I run it on my ASUS ProArt PX13 laptop (AMD Radeon 8060S) and my desktop (NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti). It is not an official niri release and is not affiliated with the niri project.

## Where it comes from

```
niri-wm/niri                    upstream niri (no HDR yet)
└── dividebysandwich/niri       hdr-smithay-master: HDR through Smithay color management
    └── gonzalezerik/niri       erikg-hdr (this branch): the fixes and extras below
```

Upstream niri doesn't support HDR yet; that depends on color management landing in [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay). Until then, this branch builds on [dividebysandwich/niri](https://github.com/dividebysandwich/niri)'s HDR work.

## What this branch adds

**HDR fixes**, each also submitted to dividebysandwich/niri:

| Fix | Pull request |
|---|---|
| Don't free the swapchain on blend-space changes (AMD GPU page fault after leaving HDR) | [#4](https://github.com/dividebysandwich/niri/pull/4) |
| Wait for the 10-bit probe frame before discarding its buffers | [#5](https://github.com/dividebysandwich/niri/pull/5) |
| Ride out a momentary loss of the HDR description (HDR → SDR → HDR blanking when mpv goes fullscreen) | [#6](https://github.com/dividebysandwich/niri/pull/6) |
| Prefer HDR for a window as soon as it is told to go fullscreen (games in nested gamescope starting in SDR) | [#7](https://github.com/dividebysandwich/niri/pull/7) |

**Per-output color profiles** (only in this branch): color correction from an ICC profile or the display's EDID, applied in the GPU's display pipeline, similar to KDE Plasma's "Color profile" setting. See [Configuration: Color Profiles](docs/wiki/Configuration:-Color-Profiles.md).

**Auto-rotate** (only in this branch): rotates an output from the accelerometer through iio-sensor-proxy, for 2-in-1 laptops like the PX13. Carried from [niri-wm/niri#3763](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/pull/3763) by Rio Sanjaya ([@oisanjaya](https://github.com/oisanjaya)), squashed into one commit; all credit to them.

## Using it

Build it the same way as upstream niri. Smithay comes from [dividebysandwich/smithay](https://github.com/dividebysandwich/smithay) `ds-hdr-master`, pinned in `Cargo.toml`, so no local Smithay checkout is needed.

```kdl
output "eDP-1" {
    hdr mode="auto"   // HDR while a fullscreen app shows HDR content
    auto-rotate       // follow the accelerometer (needs iio-sensor-proxy)
}

color-profile "eDP-1" {
    source "icc"
    icc "~/.local/share/icc/panel.icm"
}
```

- HDR options: [Configuration: Outputs, `hdr`](docs/wiki/Configuration:-Outputs.md#hdr). HDR is experimental: it is limited to a single fullscreen application, and screenshots of HDR content come out in SDR.
- Color profiles: [Configuration: Color Profiles](docs/wiki/Configuration:-Color-Profiles.md).

## Status

Personal and experimental; tested only on my two machines. Please don't report problems with this branch to upstream niri.

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never "overflow" onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there's always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Workspaces.html) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Window-Rules.html#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Screencasting.html#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html) page.
Grab a desktop shell like [DankMaterialShell] or [Noctalia] (or build a more traditional setup): niri by itself is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out [awesome-niri], a list of niri-related links and projects.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol's page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I've seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: [integrated](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite) via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.

## Contributing

If you'd like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell's global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- Hyprland has a built-in [scrolling layout](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Layouts/Scrolling-Layout/).
- [Paneru] and [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.
